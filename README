uShuffle software is available at:
  http://digital.cs.usu.edu/~mjiang/ushuffle/


Installation
============
download the code, then run "make":
  $ git clone git://github.com/agordon/fasta_ushuffle.git
  $ cd fasta_ushuffle
  $ make

If needed, copy the executables to your bin directory:
  $ sudo cp fasta_ushuffle ushuffle /usr/local/bin


Usage
=====

$ ./fasta_ushuffle -h
fasta_ushuffle: shuffles biological sequences while preserving the k-let counts.

VERSION 0.2


Copyright (C) 2010 A. gordon (gordon@cshl.edu).

Uses the uShuffle library code by: Minghui Jiang, James Anderson, Joel Gillespie, and Martin Mayne.

Usage: fasta_ushuffle [-r N] [-h] [-o] [-n N] [-k N] [-s N] < INPUT.FA > OUTPUT.FA

 -h  	This help screen
 -o            Print original (unshuffled) in output file.
 -k N		specifies the let size
 -s N		specifies the seed for random number generator.
 -n N          For each input sequence, print N permutations (default is 1).
               Use this only for debugging.
 -r N          Retry N times to find a new shuffle (Default is 10). After N retries, a warning is printed, and a non-shuffled sequence will be written.

Nucleotide sequences in the input FASTA file must be in a single line.
This is a valid input file:
  >dummy1
  AGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGAGTG
  >dummy2
  CTGAGAGTCACACATGATTTTACAACAACCATGAAG

This is not a valid input file:
  >dummy1
  AGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAG
  TAGTAGAGTG
  >dummy2
  CTGAGAGTCACACATGATTTTACAAC
  AACCATGAAG

Use fasta_formatter (from the FASTX-Toolkit) to re-format a multiline fasta file.


Example
=======

  $ ./fasta_ushuffle < test1.fa
  >hello
  ACGGGTTAAACCCGTTNN
  >world
  AGAAGTGAGTGTTGAGTAAGTACATTAGA
